# RVDHSeatsBot
Telegram Bot designed to check the number of seats in the Ridge View Residential College Dining Hall.

### How to use
1. Create a telegram token from Telegram's botfather and fill in the placeholder token strings in main.py.
2. Upload the bot to Heroku, and update the Heroku website string in main.py

### Possible Improvements
Instead of using bs4 and regex to obtain the seats amount, the API from the website could be called directly.
